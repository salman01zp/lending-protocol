# Miden Lending Protocol - Project Structure

## Overview
This is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built for the Miden blockchain using Miden Assembly (MASM) and Rust.

## Core Components

### 1. Accounts (Smart Contracts)

#### LendingPool Account (`lending_pool.masm`)
- **Purpose**: Main liquidity pool that manages deposits, withdrawals, and tracks reserves
- **Features**:
  - Deposit/withdraw functionality
  - Interest rate updates
  - Reserve data management for multiple assets (USDC, DAI, WETH)
  - Utilization tracking

#### User Lending Account (`user_lending.masm`)
- **Purpose**: User's personal account for managing collateral and debt
- **Features**:
  - Supply/withdraw collateral
  - Record borrows and repayments
  - Health factor calculation
  - Local asset storage

#### Price Oracle Account (`price_oracle.masm`)
- **Purpose**: Stores and manages asset prices
- **Features**:
  - Get/update asset prices
  - Price timestamp tracking
  - Multi-asset price queries
  - 8-decimal precision (Chainlink-style)

### 2. Modules

#### Interest Rate Strategy (`interest_rate.masm`)
- **Purpose**: Calculate supply and borrow rates based on utilization
- **Model**: Two-slope interest rate model (similar to Aave)
- **Parameters**:
  - Optimal utilization: 90% (for stablecoins)
  - Slope 1: 4%
  - Slope 2: 60%
  - Reserve factor: 10%

### 3. Client (Rust)

The Rust client provides an interface to interact with the Miden lending protocol:
- Account creation and management
- Transaction building and execution
- Note creation and consumption
- Query functions for account data

## Asset Support

Currently configured for:
- **USDC** (Asset ID: 1) - Stablecoin
- **DAI** (Asset ID: 2) - Stablecoin
- **WETH** (Asset ID: 3) - Wrapped Ether
- **WBTC** (Asset ID: 4) - Wrapped Bitcoin (oracle only)

## Storage Architecture

### LendingPool Storage Slots
- 0-6: USDC reserve (liquidity, borrowed, rates, indices)
- 7-12: DAI reserve
- 13-18: WETH reserve

### User Account Storage Slots
- 0-2: Collateral (USDC, DAI, WETH)
- 3-5: Debt (USDC, DAI, WETH)
- 6: Health factor

### Oracle Storage Slots
- 0-3: Asset prices
- 4-7: Price timestamps

## Key Features

### 1. Account Abstraction
All users deploy their own lending account (smart contract) that manages their positions locally.

### 2. Note-Based Transfers
Assets are transferred between accounts using Miden's note system:
- Deposit: User â†’ Pool (via deposit note)
- Borrow: Pool â†’ User (via borrow note)
- Repay: User â†’ Pool (via repayment note)

### 3. Privacy-First
- Private accounts: Off-chain state, on-chain commitments
- Public accounts: Full on-chain state (optional)

### 4. ZK Proofs
- Client-side transaction proving
- Health factor verification via ZK proofs
- Lower on-chain costs
